# ✔N-Queen Visualiser

- The N-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

- The condition that no two queens kill each other can be achieved using more than one configuration and all these configurations are displayed using backtracking, 
otherwise we could have even found optimal solution using dynamic programming.
