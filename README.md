# âœ”N-Queen Visualiser

- The N-Queens puzzle is place "N" numbers of queens on an "N x N" chessboard so that none of the Queens attack each other vertically, horizontally or diagonally. 

- The condition that no two queens kill each other can be achieved using more than one configuration and all these configurations are displayed using backtracking, 
otherwise we could have even found optimal solution using dynamic programming.
